# Audio-sentinel-Detect
 AI-Powered Deepfake Audio Detection System
 Overview
Audio-Sentinel-Detect is an advanced deepfake audio detection system designed to identify AI-generated speech in real-time or near real-time. Using cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this tool aims to preserve digital trust by detecting synthetic manipulations in speech data.

#🚀 Features
✔️ Deep Learning-Based Detection: Utilizes CNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers for feature extraction and classification.
✔️ Real-Time or Batch Processing: Optimized for both live conversations and offline dataset analysis.
✔️ Pretrained Models Support: Compatible with ASVspoof, FakeAVCeleb, and other datasets.
✔️ Librosa-Powered Preprocessing: Extracts MFCCs, spectrograms, and other key audio features.
✔️ PyTorch & TensorFlow Support: Implements models using scalable deep learning frameworks.
✔️ Modular Codebase: Easy integration with various audio processing pipelines.

🔧 Installation
#1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/zubair-ahmad-beigh/Audio-Sentinel-Detect.git
cd Audio-Sentinel-Detect

#2️⃣ Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
#🗂️ Dataset

This project supports multiple deepfake audio datasets, including:
ASVspoof 2021
FakeAVCeleb
WaveFake

To use, download and place the dataset in the dataset/ folder.

#🧠 Model Training
Run the training script with default parameters:

python src/train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 32 --model "CNN_LSTM"
This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model in the models/ directory.


#🎯 Real-Time Detection
Detect deepfake audio in real-time using a microphone or pre-recorded file:
python src/detect.py --input "sample_audio.wav"
Output:

{
    "file": "sample_audio.wav",
    "prediction": "Deepfake",
    "confidence": 97.5
}
#📊 Evaluation & Performance Metrics
To evaluate the model on a test dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python src/evaluate.py --dataset "ASVspoof"
#Metrics Tracked:
